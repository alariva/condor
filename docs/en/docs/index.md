# Welcome to Condor

## Introduction

Supervising our organization's infrastructure should ensure us peace of mind, instead of just more hassle.

This inspires us to create a panoramic view with all the relevant resources within reach.

> Condor watches diverse statuses, and elegantly reports every drift.

## What does it watch for?

Condor watches for different **Aspects** of your servers.

### Aspects

  * **Uptime**: Verify that your site or app is up and running.
  * **Whois**: Anticipate to expiry dates of Domain Names.
  * **SSLCertificates**: Anticipate to expiry dates of SSL Certificates.

> Yes, Condor will be adding more Aspects to monitor in the near future.
